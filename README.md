2.Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: folium, pandas, numpy, re, matplotlib, requests, geopandas, branca
- Install Python if you haven't already.
- Install the required libraries by running pip install folium pandas numpy matplotlib requests geopandas branca.

3.Usage
- Run the provided Python script in a Python environment. Make sure to run it in a Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab for interactive visualization.
- The script fetches COVID-19 data from an online source and reads the geojson file for India.
